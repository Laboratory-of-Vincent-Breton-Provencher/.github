## Hi there 👋

Our lab aims at understanding the neuronal correlates of learning, execution, and optimization of cognitive tasks. We are particularly interested in determining the roles of catecholamines – noradrenaline and dopamine – in these behavioral processes. Our main objective is to determine when catecholaminergic neurons are active during behavior, what are the inputs causing this activity, and how the release of dopamine and noradrenaline affects neuronal activity in target regions. Our ultimate goal is to use this understanding of the native function of catecholamines to develop new therapeutic treatments for neurological disorders and diseases.

Some of the method we are using are listed bellow:
- Multi-photon microscopy
- Targeted *in vivo* electrophysiology
- Large-scale *in vivo* electrophysiology
- Micro-endoscopy
- Quantitative mouse behavior
- Anatomical tracing
- Fiber photometry

### Some projects
#### Circuit controlling noradrenaline
What is the origin of noradrenergic activity during behavior? In this project, we study how inputs from various regions of cortical and subcortical networks affect noradrenergic responses during learned behaviors. To do so, we combine anatomic tracings with in vivo targeted recordings of various neuronal populations controlling the locus coeruleus neuronal activity.

#### Synergistic role of catecholamines in behaviors
Recent studies on noradrenaline and dopamine have shown that these two systems share similar neurophysiological functions during behaviors. Both systems seem to provide strong execution and learning signals, but how the synergistic release of these two neurotransmitter affects target circuits remains greatly understudied. We examine this role by combining two-photon functional imaging of targeted populations, dense electrode arrays recordings, and optogenetic manipulations of the prefrontal cortex in behaving mice.
